# openHome
This is a initiative that strives to provide an OpenSource protocol that enables secure yet fast and user friendly smart home / IoT devices to interact with each other on a common base.
It is ment to adress the most common problems many of today's implementations have. To give some examples:
- Decentralized structure to remove the need for a Hub and to enable partitioned networks
- Full encryption of all communication as a base layer of security
- Group based permission handling by another encryption layer
- Inheritance of permissions and properties
